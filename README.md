This repository includes two astrophysics research projects I worked on, each involving data analysis and theoretical interpretation

Measuring Cosmological Parameters Using Type Ia Supernovae
Analyzed the Pantheon+ SH0ES dataset to estimate the Hubble constant and the age of the universe. This involved plotting the Hubble diagram, fitting a cosmological model, analyzing residuals, and comparing model behavior across redshift ranges.

Estimating the Dynamical Mass of a Galaxy Cluster
Used spectroscopic redshift data from the SDSS survey to identify cluster member galaxies. Applied the virial theorem to estimate the clusterâ€™s total gravitational (dynamical) mass and compared it with luminous mass to infer the presence of dark matter.
